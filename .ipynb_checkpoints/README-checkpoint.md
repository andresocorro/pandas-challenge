# pandas-challenge

 This assignment consisted in analzying videogame data using pandas to understand what add-ons are being purchased in our Heroes of Pymoli game and what is driving these purchases.
 
  We used different functions of pandas such as groupby and bins in order to read through the data and do some basic statistical analysis on it based on different categories, such as age group, gender and the items themselves being purchased.
  
  Once we had the category we wanted to look at grouped, the basic analysis we did was along the lines of how many items these groups were buying, how much they were spending on average and total.
  
  This analysis helped us understand the data better so that we can decide on how to best proceed next. It helped us see who is buying the most items (males and people between the ages of 15-24). but that females or other are spending more on average for example. It helped is that Final Cric and Oath Breaker were the most popular items bought, which is also important to know.
  
  The next thing logically would be then to be able to graph this data to be able to present it to the decision makers of this company so they can act upon our findings.
